# Statistics-Simulations
Various simulations of common statistical situations

While I took my AP statistics course, I was intruigued at how intricate some situations were. I thought it would be useful to try and program a few of these situtations to get a better understanding of them.
The list is by no means done, and as I continue learning, I'll continue updating the rep. It also contains a simulation for some weighted random numbers which can simulate effectively any density curve, even if bounded area is not 1. Feel Free to make changes or just look through the code!
